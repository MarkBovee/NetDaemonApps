## üîã Smart Battery Management: 3-Checkpoint Strategy

The Energy/Battery app features an intelligent optimization strategy that adapts to price trends and battery conditions throughout the day. This advanced system maximizes energy savings and revenue by making smart decisions at three critical checkpoints.

### How It Works

#### üåÖ **Checkpoint 1: Morning Evaluation (Pre-Charge)**
- **When**: 2 hours before the planned charging period
- **Logic**: Checks current battery State of Charge (SOC)
- **Action**: If SOC > 40%, automatically adds a morning discharge during high price periods (6 AM - charge time)
- **Benefit**: Captures morning price peaks when battery has sufficient capacity

#### ‚ö° **Checkpoint 2: Optimal Charging**
- **When**: During the lowest price period of the day (typically 2-5 AM)
- **Action**: Fills battery when energy costs are minimal
- **EMS Integration**: Automatically shuts down Energy Management System 5 minutes before charging to prevent conflicts

#### üåÜ **Checkpoint 3: Evening Price Comparison**
- **When**: 30 minutes before scheduled evening discharge
- **Logic**: Compares tomorrow morning prices (6-12 AM) vs tonight's evening prices
- **Decision**:
  - If **tomorrow morning price > tonight evening price**: Cancels tonight's discharge and reschedules for tomorrow morning
  - If **tonight evening price ‚â• tomorrow morning price**: Keeps original evening discharge schedule
- **Benefit**: Maximizes revenue by choosing the most profitable discharge timing

### üìÖ Day-Specific Scheduling (NEW!)

The battery system now supports precise day-of-week targeting for optimal scheduling:

- **Weekday Format**: Uses "1,1,1,1,1,1,1" pattern (Monday through Sunday, 1=active, 0=inactive)
- **Smart Targeting**:
  - **Charge periods**: Automatically target tomorrow's day for optimal schedule application
  - **Discharge periods**: Target today's day for immediate application
- **Configuration**: Enable with `EnableDaySpecificScheduling: true` in battery options
- **Benefits**: Avoid daily schedules running every day - precise surgical control for energy optimization

### üîÑ Optimization Schedule

#### **üìÖ Daily Schedule Preparation**
- **Once per day** at **00:05** (5 minutes after midnight)
- Full recalculation of the entire day's charging/discharging schedule
- Uses latest energy price data and battery parameters

#### **‚ö° Continuous Monitoring & Status Updates**
- **Battery Mode Monitoring**: Every **5 minutes**
  - Checks SAJ Power API for current battery mode (EMS/Manual/etc.)
  - Updates Home Assistant entities with current status
  
- **Schedule Status Updates**: Every **1 minute** 
  - Updates dashboard with current schedule status
  - Provides responsive UI feedback

#### **üîß Dynamic Adjustments**
- **Real-time EMS Management**: The system doesn't constantly re-optimize the schedule, but it does:
  - Monitor for EMS mode conflicts and automatically retry when needed
  - Apply/remove EMS mode precisely at scheduled charge/discharge windows
  - Handle retries with 5-minute intervals when battery is in conflicting mode

#### **üéØ Key Schedule Events**
1. **00:05 Daily**: Complete schedule recalculation for the new day
2. **Before each period**: EMS mode disabled 5 minutes before charge/discharge starts
3. **During periods**: EMS mode enabled during active charge/discharge windows
4. **After periods**: EMS mode restored after completion

#### **‚öôÔ∏è Retry Logic**
- If price data isn't available at 00:05, retry every **10 minutes**
- If battery is in EMS mode when trying to apply schedule, retry every **5 minutes**
- Failed operations are logged and rescheduled automatically

### Technical Features

- **EMS Management**: Automatically handles Energy Management System shutdown/restore with proper timing buffers
- **State Persistence**: Maintains schedules across daemon restarts using robust state management
- **SAJ Power Integration**: Full API integration for applying schedules to SAJ Power battery systems
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for all decisions, price comparisons, and schedule changes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and recovery from API failures or missing data

### Configuration Requirements

- **Home Assistant Entities**:
  - `switch.ems` - Energy Management System control
  - Battery SOC sensors (main inverter + individual modules)
  - Price data from energy provider integration

- **SAJ Power Battery**: Valid credentials and network access to battery system

### Example Daily Flow

```text
00:05 - Daily schedule calculation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SOC Check: 65% ‚Üí Add morning discharge at 08:00-09:00 (‚Ç¨0.45/kWh) [Wed only]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Charge: 02:00-05:00 at ‚Ç¨0.18/kWh [Thu only - tomorrow]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Evening discharge: 20:00-21:00 at ‚Ç¨0.38/kWh [Wed only - today]

19:30 - Evening price comparison
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tonight: ‚Ç¨0.38/kWh at 20:00
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tomorrow morning: ‚Ç¨0.47/kWh at 08:00
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Decision: Cancel tonight, reschedule for tomorrow 08:00

Result: Precise day targeting with surgical schedule application
```

## How It Works (For Everyone)

- The daemon connects to your Home Assistant instance and runs automation apps in real-time.
- Each app is focused on a specific area (energy, security, etc.) and works out-of-the-box.
- Configuration is managed via Home Assistant and appsettings files.

---

## Getting Started (For Developers)

### 1. Code Generation (Entities & Services)

To keep your automations up-to-date with your Home Assistant setup, generate entity and service classes:

```powershell
# Restore required .NET tools
dotnet tool restore

# Generate entity/service code from Home Assistant metadata
dotnet tool run nd-codegen
```

This will update `HomeAssistantGenerated.cs` and related files based on your Home Assistant configuration.

### 2. Configuration

Edit `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json` to set up your Home Assistant connection and app preferences.

---

## Publishing to Home Assistant

1. **Build the Project**
   
   ```powershell
   dotnet build
   ```

2. **Publish the Daemon**
   
   ```powershell
   dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
   ```

3. **Deploy to Home Assistant**
   - Copy the contents of the `publish` folder to your Home Assistant server.
   - Configure the daemon to run as a service or via Docker, depending on your setup.
   - Ensure your Home Assistant instance is accessible and credentials are set in the configuration files.

---

## üêõ Debugging & Verification

### Battery Strategy Debugging

- **Debug Mode**: When running with a debugger attached, the Battery app simulates all operations without actually applying schedules to the battery system
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All checkpoint decisions, price comparisons, and schedule changes are logged with detailed information
- **State Inspection**: Use Home Assistant's Developer Tools to check `input_text.battery_charge_schedule` and `input_text.battery_discharge_schedule` entities for current schedules
- **EMS Monitoring**: Watch the `switch.ems` entity to verify proper shutdown/restore timing around battery periods

### Vacation Lighting Debugging

- When running in debug mode (with a debugger attached), the Vacation/LightsOnVacation app will log the list of entities it considers to be lights or lamps. This helps you verify and tune the filter so only real lamps are included.
- In production, only these entities will be controlled for vacation lighting.
