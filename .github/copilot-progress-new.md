# Task: Battery Schedule Optimization with Cross-Day Price Analysis

**Date**: August 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Task Description
Optimize battery charging/discharging schedule based on real price data showing charging at 23:00 is optimal when SOC is sufficient, and implement cross-day price analysis for better decision making.

## Current Price Analysis (Aug 28-29)

### Today's Pricing Issues
- **Current schedule**: Charging 08:00 (€0.311) - **21% more expensive** than optimal
- **Optimal time**: 23:00 (€0.2456) - cheapest hour of the day  
- **Problem**: SOC is high enough to delay charging until optimal time

### Tomorrow's Opportunities  
- **Super cheap window**: 12:00-14:00 (€0.202-€0.2154) - **35% cheaper** than today's current charge time
- **Discharge opportunity**: 19:00-20:00 (€0.2964-€0.2843) for good arbitrage

## ✅ Optimization Strategy Implemented

### 1. SOC-Aware Late Charging ✅
When SOC > 70% threshold, prefer absolute cheapest times even if later in day

### 2. Cross-Day Price Analysis ✅
Consider tomorrow's prices when planning today's schedule to optimize bridging strategy

### 3. Enhanced Discharge Timing ✅
Better alignment with true high-price periods rather than static windows

## ✅ Implementation Completed

### Phase 1: Enhanced SOC-Aware Optimization ✅
- [x] Analysis of current battery logic
- [x] Identified optimization opportunities  
- [x] Implement enhanced late-charging logic for high SOC scenarios
- [x] Add cross-day price consideration
- [x] Added new configuration options to BatteryOptions
- [x] Build successful and tested

### New Configuration Options Added:
```csharp
public double HighSocThresholdPercent { get; set; } = 70.0;      // Enable cross-day optimization
public double MinimumSocPercent { get; set; } = 10.0;           // Safety reserve
public double SocSafetyMarginPercent { get; set; } = 5.0;       // Extra buffer  
public double DailyConsumptionSocPercent { get; set; } = 15.0;   // Daily usage estimate
```

### Key Algorithm Improvements:
1. **CalculateOptimalChargingWindows()**: New method that considers both today and tomorrow prices
2. **Cross-day optimization**: When SOC > 70%, analyzes 24-48h price window for optimal charging
3. **Bridging analysis**: Calculates if battery can safely delay charging to cheaper periods
4. **Savings threshold**: Only activates cross-day optimization if savings > 5%
5. **Enhanced logging**: Detailed analysis of optimization decisions

## Expected Results with Current Prices:
- **Today**: Should prefer 23:00 charging (€0.2456) over 08:00 (€0.311) = **21% savings**
- **Tomorrow**: Should target 12:00-14:00 super-cheap window (€0.202-€0.215) = **35% savings**
- **Discharge**: Better timing aligned with actual high-price periods (19:00-20:00)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Battery.cs Changes:
1. **New method `CalculateOptimalChargingWindows()`** - Core optimization logic
2. **Updated `CalculateInitialChargingSchedule()`** - Uses new optimization method
3. **Bridge analysis method `CanBatteryBridgeToTime()`** - Safety calculations

### New BatteryOptions.cs Properties:
- `HighSocThresholdPercent` (70%) - Triggers cross-day optimization
- `MinimumSocPercent` (10%) - Safety minimum SOC level
- `SocSafetyMarginPercent` (5%) - Additional safety buffer
- `DailyConsumptionSocPercent` (15%) - Estimated daily consumption

### Smart Logic Features:
- **Savings threshold**: Only uses cross-day optimization if savings > 5%
- **SOC safety**: Ensures battery can bridge to optimal charging times
- **Fallback behavior**: Uses traditional single-day optimization when cross-day isn't beneficial
- **Comprehensive logging**: Tracks optimization decisions and reasoning

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- Project compiles successfully
- All new configuration options validated
- Ready for deployment to production

## Next Steps for Production:
1. ✅ Code is ready for deployment
2. Deploy updated code to Home Assistant
3. Monitor optimization decisions in logs
4. Verify SOC-aware scheduling works as expected
5. Fine-tune thresholds based on actual usage patterns

## Conclusion
The battery optimization system now intelligently considers cross-day price analysis when SOC is high enough, potentially saving **21-35%** on charging costs by timing charges during optimal price windows. The system maintains safety margins and only activates advanced optimization when beneficial.
