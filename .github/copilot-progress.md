## Current Session: Code Refactoring - Extract Methods for Better Maintainability

**Date**: August 27, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress - Paused

### Summary

Working on refactoring the Battery.cs file to extract duplicate code into smaller, more maintainable functions. Focus is on reducing code duplication and improving readability.

### Detailed Steps

- [x] Analyzed Battery.cs file structure and identified refactoring opportunities
- [x] Created refactoring plan with priorities
- [x] Extracted `ValidateAndTurnOffEmsAsync()` method from duplicated EMS logic
- [x] Added new method to EMS Management region
- [x] Updated `PrepareForBatteryPeriodAsync` to use extracted method
- [x] Updated `PrepareForScheduleAsync` to use extracted method  
- [x] Simplified retry scheduling logic
- [ ] Extract morning discharge logic from `CreateDynamicSchedule` method
- [ ] Break down large methods into focused smaller methods
- [ ] Extract common schedule application patterns
- [ ] Test all refactoring changes with build
- [ ] Verify no behavioral changes

### Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
1. `Apps/Energy/Battery.cs` - Extracted EMS validation logic into reusable method

**Key Refactoring Completed:**
- **Extracted Method**: `ValidateAndTurnOffEmsAsync()` - Consolidates duplicate EMS checking logic
- **Simplified Retry Logic**: Reduced complexity in both `PrepareForBatteryPeriodAsync` and `PrepareForScheduleAsync`
- **Removed Code Duplication**: ~30 lines of duplicate EMS validation code eliminated

**Refactoring Plan Identified:**

1. **High Priority - ✅ COMPLETED**: Extract duplicated EMS logic
   - Found identical EMS checking logic in `PrepareForBatteryPeriodAsync` and `PrepareForScheduleAsync`
   - Extracted to: `ValidateAndTurnOffEmsAsync()`

2. **Medium Priority - NEXT**: Break down large methods
   - `CreateDynamicSchedule` (~150 lines) → Extract morning discharge logic 
   - `PrepareForBatteryPeriodAsync` → Further simplification possible

3. **Low Priority - FUTURE**: Extract common patterns
   - Retry scheduling logic patterns
   - Schedule application logic patterns

### Technical Approach

- Following single responsibility principle
- Maintaining existing error handling patterns
- Using async/await consistently
- Preserving all logging and status reporting
- No behavioral changes - pure refactoring

### Current Code Structure Improvements

**Before**: Duplicate EMS validation logic in multiple methods (60+ lines duplicated)
**After**: Single reusable `ValidateAndTurnOffEmsAsync()` method (20 lines)

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved maintainability
- Centralized EMS validation logic
- Easier to test and debug EMS functionality

### Next Steps

1. Extract morning discharge creation logic from `CreateDynamicSchedule`
2. Consider breaking down other large methods (>50 lines)
3. Test all changes with build verification
4. Document any behavioral implications

### Issues Encountered

- None yet - refactoring proceeding smoothly

## Previous Session: Configuration Enhancement for Battery SOC Thresholds
4. Update any related documentation

### Issues Encountered

- Build errors due to leftover evening SOC threshold references - Fixed by removing evening SOC check logic

### Task Completion Summary

**What was implemented:**
- Added `MorningSocThresholdPercent` property to `BatteryOptions.cs` with default value of 40%
- Updated `appsettings.json` with configurable morning SOC threshold
- Modified morning discharge logic in `Battery.cs` to use `_options.MorningSocThresholdPercent` instead of hardcoded 40.0
- Updated logging to display the configurable threshold value
- Removed evening SOC check logic to avoid build errors (evening SOC feature postponed)

**Technical approach:**
- Followed existing dependency injection pattern with strongly-typed configuration
- Maintained backward compatibility with sensible 40% default value
- Used existing naming conventions and documentation standards

**Testing/Verification:**
- Build successful with no errors (only existing warnings unrelated to changes)
- Code compiles cleanly with .NET 9.0 target

**Key benefit:**
Users can now adjust the morning discharge SOC threshold by simply changing the `MorningSocThresholdPercent` value in appsettings.json without requiring code changes or recompilation.
