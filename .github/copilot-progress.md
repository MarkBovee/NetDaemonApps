# Battery Schedule Logic Refactoring - August 29, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**  
**Date**: August 29, 2025

## ‚úÖ Task Completed Successfully & Deployed

Successfully refactored and deployed the battery schedule logic to production. The system now works correctly according to user requirements and is live in the NetDaemon5 environment.

### üöÄ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED**
- **Published to**: NetDaemon5 environment
- **Deployment time**: August 29, 2025 09:44
- **Status**: Live and operational

### üéØ Key Accomplishments

1. **‚úÖ Development Environment Auto-Termination**: 
   - Changed from debugger detection to development environment detection
   - Program automatically terminates after 10 seconds in development mode
   - Eliminates manual cancellation during debugging

2. **‚úÖ Price-Based Schedule Creation**:
   - Refactored `CalculateInitialChargingSchedule()` to create schedules based purely on electricity prices
   - Removed SOC filtering from schedule creation phase
   - System now creates optimal charge/discharge windows regardless of current SOC

3. **‚úÖ Execution-Time SOC Validation**:
   - Added message: "Schedule created based on prices | Evening discharge will be validated at execution time"
   - SOC checks now happen when periods are about to execute, not during creation
   - Prevents stale SOC predictions from invalidating good price-based schedules

4. **‚úÖ Fixed Zero-Duration Periods**:
   - Evening discharge now shows 19:00-19:59 (1 hour) instead of 19:00-19:00 (0 hours)
   - Periods are created with proper durations based on price analysis

### üìä Verified Results (from test run):

**Perfect Schedule Created**:
- **Charge Period**: 12:00-14:59 (during cheapest prices: ‚Ç¨0.2154, ‚Ç¨0.202)
- **Discharge Period**: 19:00-19:59 (during expensive price: ‚Ç¨0.2964)
- **Current SOC**: 15.0% (correctly not filtering out discharge period during creation)
- **Target SOC**: 30.0% (will be validated at execution time)

**Correct Weekday Patterns**:
- Charge: Saturday pattern `0,0,0,0,0,1,0` (tomorrow's charge window)
- Discharge: Friday pattern `0,0,0,0,1,0,0` (today's discharge window)

### üîß Implementation Details

**Modified Methods**:
- `CalculateInitialChargingSchedule()`: Removed SOC-based filtering, always creates price-optimal periods
- `CreateEveningDischargePeriod()`: Now creates fixed 1-hour periods during high-price windows
- `Program.cs`: Changed to development environment detection for auto-termination

**Architecture Improvement**:
- **Phase 1**: Create optimal schedule based on electricity prices
- **Phase 2**: Validate SOC requirements at execution time
- **Result**: More reliable schedules that respond to actual battery state when needed

### üìà Production Impact

- **Reliable Scheduling**: No more zero-duration periods or invalid schedules
- **Price Optimization**: Always charges during cheapest hours, discharges during expensive hours
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: SOC validation happens when relevant, not hours in advance
- **Better User Experience**: Dashboard shows meaningful schedule information
- **Better approach**: Create basic schedule based on price patterns only, then check SOC dynamically before each action

## Proposed Solution Architecture
1. **Price-based schedule creation**: Generate charge/discharge windows based purely on electricity prices
2. **Dynamic SOC evaluation**: Check actual SOC right before executing each scheduled action
3. **Remove predictive SOC logic**: Stop trying to calculate future SOC states during schedule preparation
4. **Runtime decision making**: Each scheduled action evaluates current conditions before executing

## Next Steps  
1. ‚úÖ Review price data and confirm optimal charge/discharge windows
2. ‚úÖ Identify architecture problem with predictive SOC calculations
3. ‚è≥ Refactor schedule creation to be price-only based
4. ‚è≥ Move SOC checks to runtime execution phase
5. ‚è≥ Remove future SOC prediction logic
4. ‚è≥ Implement fixes and verify with current price data

### Completed Work ‚úÖ

#### Evening Discharge Target SOC Implementation
- ‚úÖ **New Configuration Option**: Added `EveningDischargeTargetSocPercent = 30.0` to BatteryOptions
- ‚úÖ **Removed Safety Margin**: Eliminated `SocSafetyMarginPercent` option for simplified configuration
- ‚úÖ **SOC-Based Duration Calculation**: Created `CalculateEveningDischargeDuration()` method to determine optimal discharge time
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Period Creation**: Added `CreateEveningDischargePeriodWithTargetSoc()` method with SOC-aware logic
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Updates**: Updated both appsettings.json files with new option
- ‚úÖ **Build Verification**: Confirmed successful compilation with no errors

#### Technical Implementation Details

1. **BatteryOptions.cs Updates**:
   ```csharp
   // Added new option
   public double EveningDischargeTargetSocPercent { get; set; } = 30.0;
   
   // Removed old option
   // public double SocSafetyMarginPercent { get; set; } = 5.0;
   ```

2. **Duration Calculation Logic**:
   ```csharp
   private double CalculateEveningDischargeDuration(double currentSoc, double targetSoc)
   {
       // Calculate SOC difference and convert to energy
       var socDifferencePercent = currentSoc - targetSoc;
       var energyToDischarge = MaxBatteryCapacityWh * (socDifferencePercent / 100.0);
       
       // Calculate time needed at current discharge power
       var dischargeDurationHours = energyToDischarge / dischargePowerW;
       
       // Apply practical limits (15 minutes minimum, 3 hours maximum)
       return Math.Max(0.25, Math.Min(3.0, dischargeDurationHours));
   }
   ```

3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed SOC-based discharge logging:
   ```
   "Evening discharge calculated: SOC: 85.0% ‚Üí 30.0%, Duration: 2.3h (20:00-22:18)"
   ```

4. **Bridge Logic Simplified**: Updated `CanBatteryBridgeToTime()` to use only `MinimumSocPercent` without safety margin

#### Production Impact
- **Precise Energy Management**: Discharge duration now calculated based on actual battery state
- **Prevent Over-Discharge**: Automatic protection against discharging below 30% target SOC
- **Optimal Energy Utilization**: Discharge exactly the right amount during peak pricing periods
- **Simplified Configuration**: Removed redundant safety margin for cleaner settings
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Detailed logging shows SOC progression and calculated durations

#### Configuration Changes
- **appsettings.json**: Added `"EveningDischargeTargetSocPercent": 30.0`
- **appsettings.Development.json**: Added `"EveningDischargeTargetSocPercent": 30.0`
- **Both files**: Removed `"SocSafetyMarginPercent": 5.0`

### Next Steps for Production
- **Monitor SOC Targeting**: Verify discharge periods stop at the 30% target SOC
- **Duration Accuracy**: Validate calculated discharge durations match actual energy needs
- **Price Optimization**: Confirm the system maximizes value during high-price periods while respecting SOC targets

This implementation provides sophisticated SOC-aware discharge management, ensuring optimal energy utilization while maintaining battery health through precise target SOC control.
- Optimize scheduling by applying periods only to relevant days

## Analysis of Current System
From ChargingPeriod.cs, the Weekdays property already exists but is always set to all days.
From Battery.cs, period creation methods don't accept day-of-week parameters.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add day-of-week parameter to period creation helper methods
2. Add utility method to generate day patterns (e.g., Monday only, weekends, etc.)
3. Update period creation calls to use specific days when beneficial
4. Add configuration options for different day patterns

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps
- [x] Analyzed current ChargingPeriod structure
- [x] Identified enhancement opportunities in Battery.cs helper methods
- [x] Added day pattern utility methods (single day, weekdays, weekends, all days)
- [x] Enhanced period creation methods with day-of-week overloads
- [x] Added configuration options for day-specific scheduling
- [x] Updated all period creation calls to use optimal patterns
- [x] Added intelligent pattern selection based on configuration
- [x] Added debug logging for day-specific scheduling decisions
- [x] Build successful - all changes compile correctly

## ‚úÖ Current Work COMPLETED
- [x] Add day-of-week parameters to period creation methods
- [x] Create utility methods for common day patterns
- [x] Update period creation logic to use optimal days
- [x] Test and validate changes

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### New Utility Methods Added:
- `GetSingleDayPattern(DayOfWeek)` - Creates pattern for specific day (e.g., "1,0,0,0,0,0,0" for Monday)
- `GetWeekdaysPattern()` - Creates pattern for business days only ("1,1,1,1,1,0,0")
- `GetWeekendsPattern()` - Creates pattern for weekends only ("0,0,0,0,0,1,1")
- `GetAllDaysPattern()` - Creates pattern for all days ("1,1,1,1,1,1,1")
- `GetOptimalWeekdayPattern()` - Intelligently selects pattern based on configuration

### Enhanced Period Creation Methods:
All period creation methods now have three variants:
1. **Original method**: Defaults to all days (backward compatible)
2. **Pattern overload**: Accepts specific weekday pattern string
3. **DayOfWeek overload**: Accepts specific day of week

### New Configuration Options (BatteryOptions):
- `EnableDaySpecificScheduling` (false) - Master switch for day-specific optimization
- `OptimizeWeekdaysOnly` (false) - Apply schedules only to business days
- `OptimizeWeekendsOnly` (false) - Apply schedules only to weekends

### Usage Examples:
```csharp
// Default (all days) - backward compatible
var period1 = CreateChargePeriod(startTime, endTime);

// Weekdays only
var period2 = CreateChargePeriod(startTime, endTime, GetWeekdaysPattern());

// Specific day (Monday)
var period3 = CreateChargePeriod(startTime, endTime, DayOfWeek.Monday);

// Based on configuration
var period4 = CreateChargePeriod(startTime, endTime, GetOptimalWeekdayPattern());
```

### Key Features:
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work unchanged
- **Flexible Configuration**: Multiple options for different household patterns
- **Smart Pattern Selection**: Automatically chooses optimal day pattern based on settings
- **Debug Logging**: Shows day-specific decisions when debugger attached
- **API Format Compliance**: Maintains SAJ Power API weekday string format
2. **Cross-day optimization**: When SOC > 70%, analyzes 24-48h price window for optimal charging
3. **Bridging analysis**: Calculates if battery can safely delay charging to cheaper periods
4. **Savings threshold**: Only activates cross-day optimization if savings > 5%
5. **Enhanced logging**: Detailed analysis of optimization decisions

## Expected Results with Current Prices:
- **Today**: Should prefer 23:00 charging (‚Ç¨0.2456) over 08:00 (‚Ç¨0.311) = **21% savings**
- **Tomorrow**: Should target 12:00-14:00 super-cheap window (‚Ç¨0.202-‚Ç¨0.215) = **35% savings**
- **Discharge**: Better timing aligned with actual high-price periods (19:00-20:00)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Battery.cs Changes:
1. **New method `CalculateOptimalChargingWindows()`** - Core optimization logic
2. **Updated `CalculateInitialChargingSchedule()`** - Uses new optimization method
3. **Bridge analysis method `CanBatteryBridgeToTime()`** - Safety calculations

### New BatteryOptions.cs Properties:
- `HighSocThresholdPercent` (70%) - Triggers cross-day optimization
- `MinimumSocPercent` (10%) - Safety minimum SOC level
- `SocSafetyMarginPercent` (5%) - Additional safety buffer
- `DailyConsumptionSocPercent` (15%) - Estimated daily consumption

### Smart Logic Features:
- **Savings threshold**: Only uses cross-day optimization if savings > 5%
- **SOC safety**: Ensures battery can bridge to optimal charging times
- **Fallback behavior**: Uses traditional single-day optimization when cross-day isn't beneficial
- **Comprehensive logging**: Tracks optimization decisions and reasoning

## Build Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- Project compiles successfully
- All new configuration options validated
- Ready for deployment to production

## Next Steps for Production:
1. ‚úÖ Code is ready for deployment
2. Deploy updated code to Home Assistant
3. Monitor optimization decisions in logs
4. Verify SOC-aware scheduling works as expected
5. Fine-tune thresholds based on actual usage patterns

## Conclusion
The battery optimization system now intelligently considers cross-day price analysis when SOC is high enough, potentially saving **21-35%** on charging costs by timing charges during optimal price windows. The system maintains safety margins and only activates advanced optimization when beneficial.
